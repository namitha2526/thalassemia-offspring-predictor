An AI-based project to predict whether an offspring is **Affected**, a **Carrier**, or **Not Affected** by Thalassemia based on the **CBC, HbA2, and HbF values** of both parents. This helps in early screening and genetic counseling.

## 🧠 What is Thalassemia?

**Thalassemia** is an inherited blood disorder that reduces the ability to produce hemoglobin and red blood cells. This project uses machine learning to predict risk levels in children using medical blood parameters of parents.

---

## 🧪 Objective

To build a predictive ML model that classifies the genetic outcome of a child as:
- `0`: Not Affected  
- `1`: Carrier  
- `2`: Affected  

Based on CBC, HbA2, and HbF values of both the mother and father.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python  
- pandas, numpy  
- scikit-learn  
- xgboost  
- matplotlib, seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook
